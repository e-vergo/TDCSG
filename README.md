# TDCSG: Two-Disk Compound Symmetry Groups

A Lean 4 formalization of the paper "Two-Disk Compound Symmetry Groups" by Hearn et al., with a focus on formalizing **Theorem 2**: the proof that GG₅ is infinite at the critical radius r = √(3 + φ).

## Overview

**Compound symmetry groups** generalize traditional geometric symmetry groups by allowing isometries to operate on overlapping but non-identical metric spaces. This project formalizes the two-disk case: groups generated by discrete rotations of two overlapping disks in the complex plane.

The formalization targets **Theorem 2**, which establishes that when both disks have 5-fold rotational symmetry at a specific critical radius involving the golden ratio, the resulting group is infinite.

```

## Main Theorem

The central result being formalized:

```lean
theorem theorem2 : GG5_critical.IsInfiniteGroup
```

Where `GG5_critical` is the two-disk system with:
- n₁ = n₂ = 5 (both disks have 5-fold rotational symmetry)
- r₁ = r₂ = √(3 + φ) where φ = (1 + √5)/2 is the golden ratio

This theorem establishes that at this specific critical radius, the group generated by the rotations is infinite.

## Mathematical Background

### Two-Disk Systems

A two-disk system consists of:
- Two closed disks centered at (-1, 0) and (1, 0) in the complex plane
- Discrete rotations: left disk rotates by -2π/n₁, right disk by -2π/n₂
- The group generated by these rotations acting on the disk union

### Key Insights

1. **Piecewise Isometries**: Each rotation preserves distances within its disk
2. **Translation Sequences**: Certain rotation sequences act as approximate translations
3. **Critical Radius**: At r = √(3 + φ), three specific sequences map line segments onto themselves with translation lengths in irrational ratio
4. **Infinite Orbits**: The irrational ratio implies the origin has an infinite orbit
