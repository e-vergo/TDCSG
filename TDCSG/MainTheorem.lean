# Statement of Main Theorem

This file contains the complete statement of Theorem 2 from "Two-Disk Compound Symmetry Groups"
(arXiv:2302.12950v1): GG5 is infinite at the critical radius.

All definitions needed to understand the theorem are imported from the Definitions modules.
The proof is in ProofOfMainTheorem.lean.

## Mathematical Background

A two-disk compound symmetry group GG(n,m) consists of:
- Two overlapping closed disks in the plane
- Generator a: rotation by 2 pi/n about the left disk center
- Generator b: rotation by 2 pi/m about the right disk center

The group GG5 = GG(5,5) uses 5-fold rotations on both disks.

The critical radius r_crit = sqrt(3 + phi) (where phi is the golden ratio) is the exact value
where the group transitions from finite to infinite.

## Main definitions (from TDCSG.Definitions)

- Plane : The Euclidean plane
- phi : The golden ratio (1 + sqrt(5))/2
- r_crit : The critical radius sqrt(3 + phi)
- leftCenter, rightCenter : Centers of the two disks at (-1, 0) and (1, 0)
- leftDisk, rightDisk : The closed disks of radius r centered at plus or minus 1
- rotateAroundPoint : Rotation about a point by an angle
- genA, genB : The two generators (5-fold rotations)
- orbit : The orbit of a point under the group action
- StatementOfTheorem : GG5 is infinite at the critical radius (in GroupAction.lean)

## Theorem Statement

**Main Theorem (Theorem 2 from the paper):**

The compound symmetry group GG(5,5) at the critical radius r_crit = sqrt(3 + phi)
has infinite order.

Formally: There exists a point p in the plane such that the orbit of p under
the GG5 group action is infinite.

Where:
- phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is the golden ratio
- r_crit = sqrt(3 + phi) is approximately 2.149
- The orbit of p is the set { g(p) | g in GG5 }
- GG5 is generated by 5-fold rotations about centers at (-1, 0) and (1, 0)

/-- **Theorem 2**: The compound symmetry group GG(5,5) at the critical radius has infinite order.

    A compound symmetry group GG(n,m) consists of:
    - Two closed disks of radius r centered at leftCenter and rightCenter
    - Generator A (genA): rotation by 2π/n about leftCenter, identity outside leftDisk
    - Generator B (genB): rotation by 2π/m about rightCenter, identity outside rightDisk

    For GG(5,5) at the critical radius r_crit = √(3 + φ) where φ = (1 + √5)/2,
    the group generated by genA and genB has infinitely many distinct elements.

    All definitions (φ, r_crit, leftCenter, rightCenter, leftDisk, rightDisk,
    genA, genB, Word, applyWord) are from TDCSG.Definitions. -/
